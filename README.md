Please go through the PPT provided to understand the grammer and various stages involved in compiling and executing the code.

The languages supports nested loops, nested if else and recursive operations as well.

Inorder to run and compile a program run, first, run compiler.cpp, and then give the path to your file.

I am also adding a 3 sample programs in the same repo you can run it to save time. 
    - 1.txt takes 2 numbers and returns the greatest of them
    - 2.txt has 3 constants x, y, z (you can change them in 2.txt file). The program will print a series x, x-y, x-2y, ..., z. 
      Here x = 5, y = 1, z = 0 (you can change these values) so you will get an output 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
    - 3.txt prints the greatest of 3 numbers(nested if else). Try changing the x, y, z values.
